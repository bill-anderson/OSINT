# reviews/acquisitions.md — the acquisition queue (documents to fetch)

A **shopping list**, not a research register. Every item is a *specific, known,
identified document* the wiki wants and does not hold — a gazetted Act, a
regulator's bulletin, a project appraisal document, a PDF behind a 403 or a
cookie wall. Nothing here needs investigating; it needs **fetching**.

Worked by the **acquisition pass** (`run acquisitions`, procedure in
`reviews/ACQUIRE.md`), never by reconcile — sending a download through an Exa
research pass wastes it. The pass takes the whole list, one automated attempt
each. What comes back is ingested via `new/` and its line struck; what a single
attempt cannot get — paywall, cookie wall, 403, anything needing a hand-clip — is
**dropped, not parked**, with its absence stated dated on the page it bears on. No
item is carried for a human loop.

Items are marked **[blocked]** (a recorded failure mode: 403, bot-block, cookie
wall, JS shell, fetch-size limit) or **[untried]** (never yet fetched).

*(Drained 2026-07-22 by the acquisition pass inside update-wiki: **both AENE items acquired** — Vote 25
chapter directly; Vote 5 via the **FullAENE full volume** (412pp — per-vote filename not exposed by the
index; the full volume also serves future votes). Staged to `new-budget/ZAF/2024/` for budget extract.)*

*(Drained 2026-07-22 by the acquisition pass — the 2 items from the ZAF FY2024/25 domestic finance
sweep, **both acquired** via the browser route after direct fetches failed. **AGSA PFMA GR 2024-25**
(14.7 MB): the legacy `Portals/0` URL bot-guards non-browser fetches, but the browser surfaced AGSA's
new site whose clean `/storage/app/media/reporting/pfma/` path curl then fetched directly. **DCDT
Annual Report 2024/25** (9.3 MB, 279 pp): Phoca Download form POST submitted in-browser
(page-context fetch → blob → manual save by Bill). Both staged to `new-budget/ZAF/` with companions
and manifest rows — outturn + audited stages for FY2024/25 now held.)*

*(Drained 2026-07-21 by the acquisition pass, then re-drained the same day inside update-wiki
iteration 2: of 3 items added by that run's ingest, **1 acquired** (IDS surveillance-spend release —
which corrected the figure the ingest had just compiled) and **2 dropped**: the Unwanted Witness report
(`dead-url`, CRAWL_NOT_FOUND) and the Spaces for Change Nigeria report (gated 74 MB download, page
serves metadata only — created 2024-10-28). Both absences stated dated on `wiki/concepts/gov.protect.md`.)*


### Added 2026-07-21 by reconcile (finance-load contradictions)

*(Drained 2026-07-21 by the acquisition pass: **all 3 items acquired**, 0 dropped, staged in `new/` as
4 clips — PAD5527, the 11 Jan 2024 press release, and the Mozambique pair (restructuring paper RES00782
and the D906-MZ partial-cancellation letter) filed separately as two documents. Nothing outstanding.)*

*(Drained 2026-07-22 by the acquisition pass — the 5 items added by that day's ingest, chunks C1/C2:
**2 acquired** (Smart Africa's own Africa AI Council release, 2025-11-17; Zambia Cyber Crimes Act No. 4
of 2025 gazetted text, parliament.gov.zm PDF) staged to `new/` as 2 clips; **3 dropped** — Kenya draft
AI policy (`not-retrievable`: ict.go.ke notice and press link only to the pre-existing National AI
Strategy 2025–2030, not the draft), PSC SITA report (`js-shell`: psc.gov.za publications gallery exposes
no report PDF), Bloomwit *Navigating Nigeria 2027* (`gated`: resources page serves only a blurb). Dated
not-held lines added to `wiki/places/KEN.md`, `wiki/places/ZAF.md`, `wiki/places/NGA.md`.)*
